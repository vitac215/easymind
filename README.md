EasyMind is a [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) powered svg concept mapping tool.

It's mainly written in D3.js and jQuery.

## Installation
EasyMind is entirely client-side, so you can simply download and run it locally by clicking on ```index.html``` (be aware that when you run it locally, the saving as png function loses some style control)..

It can also be accessed on [GitHub page](https://vitac215.github.io/easymind/) (RECOMMENDED)

## Basic Usage
* <b>Add / Delete a node</b>
   * Hover on a node and you will see a green button (add a child node) and a red button (delete the current node)
   * You can also delete a node by clicking on it and pressing the delete key
* <b>Edit text</b>
   * Click on the text in the node to edit it
* <b>Style text / node</b>
   * Style text and node by clicking on options in the navbar 
* <b>Save as png</b>
   * Save the map in png format by clicking on the image icon in the navbar
* <b>Drag and Zoom</b>
